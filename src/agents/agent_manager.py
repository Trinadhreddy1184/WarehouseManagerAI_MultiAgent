"""Coordinator for multiâ€‘agent routing.

The agent manager keeps a list of available agents and delegates user
requests to the highest scoring agent.  If multiple agents tie on the
highest score it picks the first.  Agents are expected to implement the
score/handle interface defined in :mod:`src.agents.base`.
